# GeoWeather

## Overview
We are planning on developing a "GeoWeather" which is a weather application, and through the process of building this app we will see how to work with API's and how to fetch live data from the internet. We will be developing an application which allows us to get the live weather data for the current location using the phone GPS. In addition, the app provides a search bar where the user can type in the name of the city that you want to check the weather and get the weather that way. Also it will have a feature to enable dark mode and see the interface of the mobile change accordingly.
